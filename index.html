            <h3>Technology is useful</h3>
            <p>
              I like technology because it makes everyday life easier, improves
              communication, increases productivity, fosters learning and
              personal growth, and enables innovation. It helps solve problems
              efficiently, connects people globally, and opens up new
              opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              Well-applied technology helps us, for example, to organize
              ourselves better, to learn new things, to keep track of our goals
              and personal progress, or to bridge the gap with friends or
              family.

                <p>
                  Computer science is the study of computation, information, and
                  automation. Computer science spans theoretical disciplines
                  (such as algorithms, theory of computation, and information
                  theory) to applied disciplines (including the design and
                  implementation of hardware and software).

                <p>
                  Artificial intelligence (AI) is the capability of
                  computational systems to perform tasks typically associated
                  with human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning,
                  problem-solving, perception, and decision-making. It is a
                  field of research in computer science that studies methods
                  that enable machines to perceive their environment.

                <h4>Virtual Reality</h4>
                <p>
                  Virtual reality (VR) is a simulated experience that employs 3D
                  near-eye displays and pose tracking to give the user an
                  immersive feel of a virtual world. Applications of virtual
                  reality include video games, education and business. VR is one
                  of the key technologies in the reality-virtuality continuum.
                  As such, it is different from other digital visualization
                  solutions.

                <p>
                  I like it because it feels like you're in several places at
                  once.
